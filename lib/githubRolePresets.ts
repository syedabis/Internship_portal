      "I'm a data scientist who works at the seam between messy production data and decisions people actually act on. Most of my time goes into supervised learning for churn, demand, and risk problems — gradient boosting and transformer fine-tuning where they earn their keep, plain logistic regression where they don't — plus the unglamorous work around it: point-in-time-correct feature pipelines, leakage audits, and calibration checks that keep a model honest after month three. I'm equally comfortable writing the SQL that defines a metric, the PyTorch training loop that models it, and the FastAPI service that serves it under a latency budget.\n\nI believe a model is only as good as the decision it changes, so I start from the counterfactual: what would happen without this, and how would we know? That means baselines before architectures, holdout designs that survive contact with seasonality, and experiments that measure the business outcome rather than a proxy that flatters the model. I write down assumptions where reviewers can see them, prefer an interpretable model I can defend to a stakeholder over a half-point of AUC I can't, and treat monitoring and drift alerts as part of shipping rather than a follow-up ticket. Good analysis should also be legible — I aim for a chart and three sentences that a non-technical reader can repeat correctly.",

Most of my work is pipeline engineering at scale: change-data-capture streams out of transactional Postgres and MySQL into Kafka, Spark and Flink jobs that reshape those events, and a warehouse layer modeled in dbt that analysts and ML engineers actually trust. I care as much about the unglamorous parts — backfills that can be rerun safely, schema changes that do not silently break a dashboard at 6am, storage layouts tuned so a query scans gigabytes instead of terabytes — as about the architecture diagrams. Day to day that means Python and SQL, Airflow for orchestration, Terraform and Kubernetes for the infrastructure underneath, and a lot of time reading query plans.\n\nMy working philosophy is that a data pipeline is a product with users, not a script that happens to run on a schedule. Every table I ship has an owner, a freshness expectation, and tests that fail loudly before a stakeholder notices something is wrong. I default to idempotent, replayable designs so that recovery is boring, and I treat schema contracts between producers and consumers as real commitments rather than informal agreements.

I automate the path from commit to endpoint until it is genuinely dull, because every manual step is a place where a stale feature transform or an untracked hyperparameter sneaks into production.

I care about the unglamorous parts that decide whether a product survives contact with real traffic: pagination that doesn't fall over at a million rows, background jobs that retry safely, auth flows that handle the edge cases, and CI that catches regressions before a customer does. I've taken projects from an empty repo to production on AWS and Vercel, and I've also inherited five-year-old codebases and made them fast again.\n\nI believe the fastest way to build something good is to make it observable and reversible. I ship small changes behind feature flags, instrument before I optimize, and let profiler output rather than intuition decide what gets rewritten. I write the tests that would have caught last month's incident instead of chasing a coverage number, and I treat a clear error message or a well-named migration as part of the feature, not as overhead.

I care about the details users feel but rarely name: a layout that doesn't shift, a form that recovers from a failed request, a table that stays usable at ten thousand rows.\n\nI believe the browser is a constraint, not a canvas — every megabyte of JavaScript is a tax someone pays on a mid-range phone over a slow connection. So I start from semantic HTML and progressive enhancement, reach for a library only when the platform genuinely falls short, and treat accessibility as a build requirement rather than an audit item. I write components other people can read, keep visual regression and interaction tests close to the code they protect, and prefer measured performance work over intuition.

So I optimize for clarity over cleverness: small, well-named modules, explicit boundaries between layers, and tests that document intent rather than lock in implementation details.

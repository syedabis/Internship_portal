      "I build and ship machine learning models that actually make it to production — not just notebooks. My focus is the full lifecycle: data pipelines, training, evaluation, and monitoring models once they're live. Outside of shipping features, I spend time reproducing papers to separate what's genuinely production-ready from what only works on a clean benchmark, and I'm especially interested in efficient inference and making large models cheaper to serve at scale.\n\nAt NeuralWorks AI, I built a recommendation engine that now serves 200K+ daily users, and cutting inference latency by 40% through model quantization taught me how much of ML engineering is really systems engineering in disguise. Always happy to talk shop about feature stores, model monitoring, or the messy reality of keeping ML systems reliable in production — feel free to reach out.",
